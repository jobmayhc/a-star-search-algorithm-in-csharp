## A star search algorithm using C# ##

Application for creating rastered maps and searching a shortest path between a placed start and goal

Controls are **WASD** for movement ( **TG** for z-direction but currently the standard map is only 2D ) and **space** for confirmation.

Place both start and goal, add some walls and let it calculate one shortest path.
